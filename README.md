### 👋 Hi, I'm Kashish!

I am a software engineering graduate from Carleton University, Canada and a Data Analytics graduate student at George Brown College. My undergraduate education has given me various opportunities to explore my skills and interests and has influenced my decision to build a career in the field of Data Science & Analytics. I have a strong academic background in mathematics, statistics and computer programming. Throughout my undergraduate degree, I had taken several courses in mathematics, statistics, programming as well as data science courses, which led me to develop a deep interest in pursuing a career in data analytics and gave me the fundamental knowledge required in this field. 

**📊 What got me into Data Science & Analytics**

I love Math and working with Data! Recently, I volunteered at an early-stage startup as a marketing and analytics team lead, where I experienced how a data-driven approach can lead to increased efficiency and positive results. This made me realize how important and powerful data is in making decisions in an organization and motivated me to become a Data Analyst.
